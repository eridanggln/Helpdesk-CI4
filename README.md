# Help Desk System | PT Bakti Timah Medika 🏥💻

**PT Bakti Timah Medika** is a healthcare company managing 4 hospitals and 7 clinics across the Bangka Belitung Province. To enhance internal service efficiency and communication, I developed a **web-based Help Desk system** that centralizes and streamlines service requests from all departments, with a particular focus on IT and General Affairs (GA) teams.

## Overview 🚀

The **Integrated Help Desk System** allows PT Bakti Timah Medika's internal teams to efficiently manage, track, and resolve service requests. By eliminating unstructured communication methods (such as email and WhatsApp), the system provides a structured, ticket-based approach that ensures traceability and accountability. The platform utilizes a **Kanban method** for task management, ensuring seamless workflows and task prioritization.


## Ticket Workflow Description
* **The requestor creates a ticket**
* **Ticket information is sent to the assigned officer via email**
* **The officer starts working on the ticket**
* **A status update is sent to the requestor**
* **The officer completes the ticket**
* **Another status update is sent to the requestor**
* **The requestor confirms the ticket resolution**
* **The ticket is marked as completed**
* **A notification is sent to the officer for evaluation**


## Key Features 🔑

* **Task Management with Kanban**: Organize service requests using a Kanban board for easy tracking and management of tasks.
* **Ticket-Based System**: Replaced emails and WhatsApp messages with a structured ticketing system, ensuring every request is traceable and manageable.
* **Ticket Categorization & Assignment**: Categorized tickets into different service types and assigned them to appropriate teams for faster resolution.
* **Report Ticket**: Provides detailed ticket reports based on status, category, department, and resolution time to support performance analysis and service evaluation.


## Technologies Used 🛠️

* **Backend**: CodeIgniter 4
* **Frontend**: AJAX for dynamic and seamless user interaction
* **Database**: MySQL for structured and secure data management

## Key Responsibilities 👨‍💻

* **System Design & Implementation**: Designed and implemented the task management system using the Kanban method, tailored for service request management.
* **Backend Development**: Developed the backend using **CodeIgniter 4** and ensured smooth integration with the frontend using **AJAX**.
